# Introduction

Few weeks ago, I participated in a discussion about best algorithms book. This discussion appeared in one of programming chats in the Telegram.

Although Knuth's book is respectful, it uses weird programming language for this time. The MIX, fake assembler language.

First, assembler language has too low level. Developer needs to think on registers and memory instead of details of algorithms. Then, developers can't check their implementation. MIX machine is imaginary machine, so they need the MIX emulator. Of course, they exist, but they need to find them and install them.

Python, C#, and JavaScript are simpler in implementation and checking. But they are slow enough. Developers should not think about efficiency because these languages aren't about efficiency.

Rust is the modern program language that:

A. Works on real machines.
B. Has high-level enough to think about details, not registers.
C. Has low-level enough to make efficient programs.

Thus, may be Rust is the most suitable language to program algorithms now. Looks like it's time to write new algorithms book.
