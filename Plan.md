#### Title

Algorithms in the Rust programming language

#### Target Audience

Developers who have a small programming expirience and want to extend it. They know basic imperative constructs like loops, conditions, and blocks. They have the expirience of programing in enough strongly typed language like C/C++, Java, C#, Kotlin. They understand the Rust code or they want to understand it.

#### Education Result

To teach programmers to recognize well known algorithms in the code to understand it. To show basic methods of algorithms' building. To teach programmers to make new algorithms using these methods. To teach programmers to estimate algoritmic complexity. To show basic data structures, and to teach to choose structes that suitable to solving problems.
